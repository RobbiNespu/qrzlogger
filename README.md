  2) displays available call sign info pulled from QRZ.com
  3) displays all previous QSOs with this call (pulled from QRZ.com logbook)
  4) alles the user to enter QSO specific data (date, time, report, band etc.)
  5) uploads the QSO to QRZ.com's logbook
  6) lists the last 5 logged QSOs ((pulled from QRZ.com logbook)
  7) starts again from 1)
